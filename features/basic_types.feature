Feature: adding simple literals to the execution stack

  In order to have something to pass to functions
  As I programmer
  I want to push literals onto the execution stack

  @wip
  Scenario:
    When I run `lwwn` interactively
    And I type "2"
    Then the stdout should contain:
    """
    """
    And I type ""
